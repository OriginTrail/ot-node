OriginTrail technology is a set of tools and protocols evolving as the [semantic](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) layer for Web3, built on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Its function is to empower developers and system integrators utilizing decentralized knowledge exchange supported by emerging standards and DLT networks.

This repository contains a work-in-progress code for a network node.

OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) is currently running in the OriginTrail v5 Mainnet stage. For further information about the roadmap please see our [website](https://tech.origintrail.io/roadmap).
Please see our main documentation page for more information.


## Installation

Detailed instructions for installation and configuration of OriginTrail Node:
* [API and technical documentation](https://docs.origintrail.io/)
* [Node setup](https://docs.origintrail.io/running-nodes/node-setup)



## What is OriginTrail?

A decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) is a global shared knowledge graph that is designed to benefit organizations and individuals by providing shared public infrastructure for knowledge exchange. 

The OriginTrail DKG:
* removes central authorities - is hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN)
* utilizes DIDs & Verifiable Credentials for identity and assertions management
* enables Dapps with search, integration, analytics, AI and ML capabilities for any data source: blockchains, IPFS, enterprise systems, web services, personal devices
* enables permissionless PUBLISH and QUERY operations

The OriginTrail Decentralized Network is an implementation of the OriginTrail DKG. With the ODN therefore you can query for data across a multitude of systems (discovery), to exchange it via several data exchange protocols and integrate it in your own local knowledge graph or data store.

## The OriginTrail Ecosystem is built on 3 main pillars


### Neutrality

Being an open-source, decentralized system, based on open global standards, neutrality is crucial for the OriginTrail ecosystem as it prevents vendor lock-ins, ensures integrity, and effectively breaks data silos. Neutrality means adopting co-creation principles, working with other blockchain ecosystems and solutions builders even as they may be competing in the same market on the application level.

### Usability

Both blockchain environments, as well as OriginTrail, are fundamental technologies. In order to ensure the onboarding of enterprises, there needs to be a great focus on enhancing the user experience, as solutions need to meet the expectations of rapid value generation.

### Inclusiveness

Continuing to form partnerships with technological and business global leaders that can employ the OriginTrail ecosystem for their communities. Catering to the needs of leading global communities requires us to be making strides in designing technical infrastructure and business models that support the adoption of the OriginTrail in diverse business communities.

The ODN as a network holds a growing Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with the following characteristics:
* Linked data first structure - the graph, enabling connections between data points from all published datasets on the network, conformant with Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and JSON-LD
* Schema flexibility - enabling the mapping of virtually any data model, preferably structured according to relevant standards (such as GS1 EPCIS and CBV) and recommendations (W3C Web of Things, Verifiable Credentials, PROV, etc.) for machine readability
* Identity verification - enabling the utilization of novel identity frameworks such as Self-sovereign identity, in conjunction with industry-specific identity frameworks (such as GS1 GTIN, GIAI, GRAI and other identification schemes)
* Efficient cryptographic integrity verification of subgraphs, using associated dataset graph fingerprints, computed as Merkle roots of the input datasets
* Cryptographic connection entanglement - allowing linking of data points only when specific cryptographic rules are satisfied
* Trust minimization through decentralization - utilizing a decentralized p2p overlay network for data exchange and the Ethereum blockchain in the consensus layer

Therefore the key development principles of OriginTrail ecosystem are:
* Connection-first approach - providing ways to connect the world's data into a global, decentralized knowledge graph
* Technological neutrality - avoiding technological lock-ins and striving towards agnosticism where possible
* Decentralization - designing, implementing and utilizing that are not based on trusted-third parties or centralized entities
* Privacy-by-Design approach - according to the [7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf)
* Development transparency - towards the OriginTrail Ecosystem community of developers, node holders and businesses
* Open Source Development - according to [Open Source Software principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
