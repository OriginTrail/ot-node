[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OriginTrail/ot-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OriginTrail/ot-node)

Company Website: [origintrail.io](https://origintrail.io)

__OriginTrail is building first Purpose-built Protocol for Supply Chains Based on Blockchain.__
 
This repository contains a work-in-progress code for a network node. Please have in mind that code is still __in early alpha version__ developed mostly as a quick proof of concept and although main features will work, there are many limitations. 

We expect __Test Network__ release to be available by the end of Q2 2018 as a beta of our protocol, while __Main Network__ is scheduled for Q3 2018. For further information about our roadmap please see our [website](https://origintrail.io/roadmap).
