DKG local network setup tool
========================

This tool will help you set up a local DKG v6 network running with the Ganache blockchain. It is useful for development and testing purposes and is used internally by the OriginTrail core developers.
<br/>


**Note: This tool is an internal tool used by the OriginTrail team and thus is developed for our workflow, meaning that it currently only supports MacOS**, but we encourage you to adapt it for your workflow as well.


Prerequisites
=============

* An installed and running triplestore (graph database)
  * We recommend testing with GraphDB. In order to download GraphDB, please visit their official [website](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/). Alternatively other triple stores can be used (Blazegraph, Apache Jena and other RDF native graph databases)
* An installed and running MySQL server
* You should have installed npm and Node.js (v16) or higher


# Setup instructions

In order to run the local network you fist need to clone the "ot-node" and "dkg-evm-module" repositories.
<br/>

## 1. CLONE OT-NODE REPOSITORY & INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
After cloning the **ot-node** repository, please checkout to "v6/refactor/develop" branch and install dependencies by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node.git && cd ot-node/ && git checkout v6/refactor/develop && npm install && cd ..
```
<br/>

## 2. CLONE DKG REPOSITORIES & INSTALL DKG SMART CONTRACT DEPENDENCIES
**Note:** DO NOT clone **dkg-evm-module** repository inside of the **ot-node** directory. 

Clone the **dkg-evm-module** repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module.git
```

then install dependencies with:
```bash
cd dkg-evm-module && npm install
```

and run a local Ganache blockchain instance by executing:
```bash
npm run ganache
```
<br/>


### 2.2 Create the .env file inside the "dkg-evm-module" directory and deploy DKG smart contract:
```bash
nano .env
```
and paste the following content inside (save and close):
```bash
ACCESS_KEY = http://localhost:7545 
PRIVATE_KEY = 02b39cac1532bef9dba3e36ec32d3de1e9a88f1dda597d3ac6e2130aed9adc4e
```
**Note:** The private key above is used ONLY for convenience and SHOULD be changed to a secure key when used in production. 

After preparing the .env file, deploy DKG smart contracts by executing the following command (while Ganache is running):
```bash
npm run deploy 
```
<br/>

## 3. START THE LOCAL NETWORK

## Specifying the number of nodes
You can specify to run anywhere between one and ten nodes with the `--nodes` parameter.

**Note:** All nodes assume MySQL username root and no password. To change the MySQL login information update the .dh_origintrail_noderc template file  sequelize-repository config object with your username and password<br/>

The first node will be named `bootstrap`, while subsequent nodes will be named `dh1, dh2, ...`. <br/>

```bash
bash ./tools/local-network-setup/setup-macos-environment.sh --nodes=6
```
**Note:** With the above command, we will deploy a 6 nodes network (1 bootstrap and 5 subsequent nodes)<br/>
