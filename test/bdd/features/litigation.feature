Feature: Test various litigation scenarios
  Background: Setup local blockchain and bootstraps
    Given the blockchain is set up
    And 1 bootstrap is running

  @first
  Scenario: Test litigation for one holder which has failed to answer challenge but succeeded to answer litigation (wrongly)
    Given the replication difficulty is 1
    And I setup 4 nodes
    And I override configuration for all nodes
      | dc_holding_time_in_minutes | 5 |
      | numberOfChallenges | 100 |
      | challengeResponseTimeMills | 5000 |
    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1-EPCIS
    And DC waits for import to finish
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And I wait for replications to finish
    And I wait for challenges to start
    And I corrupt 1st holder's database ot_vertices collection
    And I wait for litigation initiation
    Then 1st holder to litigate should answer litigation
    Then Litigator node should have completed litigation
    Then 1st started holder should have been penalized
#    Then Litigator should have started replacement for penalized holder
#    Then I wait for 3 replacement replications to finish
#    Then I wait for replacement to be completed

  @third
  Scenario: Test litigation for one holder which has failed to answer challenge but succeeded to answer litigation (correctly)
    Given the replication difficulty is 1
    And I setup 4 node
    And I override configuration for all nodes
      | dc_holding_time_in_minutes | 5 |
      | numberOfChallenges | 100 |
      | challengeResponseTimeMills | 5000 |
    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1-EPCIS
    And DC waits for import to finish
    Then DC's last import's hash should be the same as one manually calculated
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And DC waits for last offer to get written to blockchain
    And I wait for replications to finish
    Then the last root hash should be the same as one manually calculated
    Then the last import should be the same on all nodes that replicated data
    And I wait for challenges to start
    And I stop 1 holder
    And I remember stopped holders
    And I wait for litigation initiation
    And I start 1st stopped holder
    Then 1st holder to litigate should answer litigation
    Then Litigator node should have completed litigation
    Then 1st started holder should not have been penalized

  @skip #to be done when we finish replacement
  Scenario: Test litigation case where same new nodes will apply for same offer
    Given the replication difficulty is 1
    And I setup 4 nodes
    When I override configuration for all nodes
      | dc_holding_time_in_minutes | 7 |
      | numberOfChallenges | 100 |
      | challengeResponseTimeMills | 5000 |
    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1-EPCIS
    And DC waits for import to finish
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And DC waits for last offer to get written to blockchain
    And I wait for replications to finish
    And I wait for challenges to start
    # Meanwhile add 2 more nodes
#    Given I additionally setup 3 nodes
#    And I start additional nodes
    # Stop the 3rd node who got the deal and and produce litigation
    When I corrupt 1st holder's database ot_vertices collection
    And I wait for litigation initiation
    Then Litigator node should have completed litigation
    Then 1st started holder should have been penalized
#    Then Litigator should have started replacement for penalized holder
#    Then I wait for 3 replacement replications to finish
#    Then I wait for replacement to be completed

  @first
  Scenario: DC should discriminate DH which has reputation lower than threshold
    Given the replication difficulty is 1
    And I setup 5 nodes
    And I override configuration for all nodes
      | dc_holding_time_in_minutes | 10 |
      | numberOfChallenges | 100 |
      | challengeResponseTimeMills | 5000 |
      | dh_min_reputation | 0 |
    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1-EPCIS
    And DC waits for import to finish
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And DC waits for last offer to get written to blockchain
    And I wait for replications to finish
    And I corrupt 1st holder's database ot_vertices collection
    When I wait for litigation initiation
    Then Litigator node should have completed litigation
    When DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/02_Green_to_Pink_receipt.xml" as GS1-EPCIS
    And DC waits for import to finish
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And DC waits for last offer to get written to blockchain
    And I wait for replications to finish
    Then Corrupted node should not have last replication dataset
