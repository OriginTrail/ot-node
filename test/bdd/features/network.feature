    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1
    Then DC's last import's hash should be the same as one manually calculated
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And I wait for replications to finish
    Then the last root hash should be the same as one manually calculated
    Then the last import should be the same on all nodes that replicated data

    And I use 6th node as DV
    Given DV publishes query consisting of path: "identifiers.id", value: "urn:epc:id:sgtin:Batch_1" and opcode: "EQ" to the network
    Then all nodes with last import should answer to last network query by DV
    Given the DV purchases last import from the last query from a DH
    Then the last import should be the same on DC and DV nodes
    Then DV's last purchase's hash should be the same as one manually calculated

  @first

    And DC waits for replication window to close
    Given I additionally setup 1 node
    And I start additional nodes
    And I use 2nd node as DV
    Given DV publishes query consisting of path: "identifiers.id", value: "urn:epc:id:sgtin:Batch_1" and opcode: "EQ" to the network
    Then all nodes with last import should answer to last network query by DV
    Given the DV purchases last import from the last query from the DC
    Then the last import should be the same on DC and DV nodes

  @first
  Scenario: 2nd DV purchases data from 1st DV, no DHes

    And I setup 1 node
    And I start the node
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1
    Then DC's last import's hash should be the same as one manually calculated
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And DC waits for replication window to close
    Given I additionally setup 1 node
    And I start additional nodes
    And I use 2nd node as DV
    Given DV publishes query consisting of path: "identifiers.id", value: "urn:epc:id:sgtin:Batch_1" and opcode: "EQ" to the network
    Then all nodes with last import should answer to last network query by DV
    Given the DV purchases last import from the last query from the DC
    Then the last import should be the same on DC and DV nodes
    Given I additionally setup 1 node
    And I start additional nodes
    And I use 3rd node as DV2
    Given DV2 publishes query consisting of path: "identifiers.id", value: "urn:epc:id:sgtin:Batch_1" and opcode: "EQ" to the network
    Then all nodes with last import should answer to last network query by DV2
    Given the DV2 purchases last import from the last query from a DV
    Then the last import should be the same on DC and DV nodes
    Then the last import should be the same on DC and DV2 nodes

  @first
  Scenario: DV should be able to publish network query regardless of the funds
    # Start node and let it create own profile. It needs some ETH and TRAC for that.
    Given I setup 1 node
    And I start the node
    And I stop the node
    # Spend all the funds and try to query network.
    When the 1st node's spend all the Tokens
    And the 1st node's spend all the Ethers
    And I start the node
    And I use 1st node as DV
    When DV publishes query consisting of path: "identifiers.id", value: "urn:epc:id:sgtin:Batch_1" and opcode: "EQ" to the network
    Then everything should be ok

  @first

    And I start the node
    And I use 1st node as DC

    And I override configuration for all nodes
      | auth_token_enabled | true |
    And I start the node
    And I use 1st node as DC
    Then API calls will not be authorized

  @first
  Scenario: Bootstraps should have /api/info route enabled
    Then 1st bootstrap should reply on info route

  @first
  Scenario: DH payout scenario
    Given the replication difficulty is 0
    And I setup 5 nodes
    And I override configuration for all nodes

    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And I wait for replications to finish
    And DC waits for holding time
    Then selected DHes should be payed out

  @first
  Scenario: DH with disabled auto-payouts
    Given the replication difficulty is 0
    And I setup 5 nodes
    And I override configuration for all nodes
      | dc_holding_time_in_minutes |   1  |

    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1
    Given DC initiates the replication for last imported dataset
    And I wait for replications to finish
    And DC waits for holding time
    Then selected DHes should not be payed out

  @first
  Scenario: Node with diff management and operational wallet should successfully start
    Given I setup 1 node
    And I set 1st node's management wallet to be different then operational wallet
    And I start the node
    Then default initial token amount should be deposited on 1st node's profile

  @third
  Scenario: Test repeated offer creation with same dataset

    And I setup 3 nodes
    And I start the nodes
    And I use 1st node as DC
    And DC imports "importers/xml_examples/Retail/01_Green_to_pink_shipment.xml" as GS1
