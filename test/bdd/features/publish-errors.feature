  @publish-errors
  Scenario: Node is not able to validate assertion on the network
    Given I setup 4 nodes
    When I call publish on ot-node 1 directly with invalidPublishRequestBody
    And I wait for last publish to finalize
    And Last publish finished with status: PublishValidateAssertionError
